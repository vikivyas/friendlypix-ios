## Requirements

The mobile FriendlyPix app need the Cloud Functions, the Realtime Database rules and the Cloud Storage rules to be deployed to work properly. You can find instructions at [FriendlyPix Web Repository](https://github.com/firebase/friendlypix-web/blob/master/README.md#mobile-apps).

## Initial setup, build tools and dependencies

Friendly Pix iOS is built using Swift and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup). The Auth flow is built using [Firebase-UI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-ios). Dependencies are managed using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). Additionally server-side micro-services are built on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).

### For Apple Xcode - Xcode - Apple Developer

Simply install the pods and open the .xcworkspace file to see the project in Xcode.

```
$ pod install
$ open your-project.xcworkspace
```

### For Non-Apple Xcode Developer && Using Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on Ubuntu. We recommend you use the default ruby.

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ruby-full
$ ruby --version
```
The output will look something like this:
```
ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
```
Further when installing CocoaPods
```
$ sudo apt-get install gem
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
Analyzing and Installing dependencies (at your project folder only)
```
$ pod install
$ open your-project.xcworkspace
```
